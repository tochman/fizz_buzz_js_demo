####Set up
Fork or download this repo (using `git clone`) and modify the files to suite your testing needs.

You can also use SVN to download this repo to your new project folder. On OSX you can install SVN using Homebrew.
```
$ brew install subversion
```

Create a new folder and `cd` into it. Run the `svn export` command to download files.

```
$ svn export https://github.com/CraftAcademy/karma-jquery-jasmine_boilerplate/trunk . --force
```
Once downloaded, you need to install all dependencies. Run
```
$ npm install
```

####Usage
You can use this setup to test your units and your jQuery events. Place your JavaScript code in `assets/js/` folder and partials in `spec/fixtures/` folder.

Your specs need to be end with `_spec.js` (e.g. `fizz_buzz_spec.js`)

Run tests with
```
$ npm test

# or

$ karma start karma.conf.js
```

####Adding tests
I have included some basic specs and `js` code for you to examine. Basically you need to build up your test environment and tear it down afterwards.
You can have different setups by nesting your `describe` blocks/functions.

```javascript
# spec/my_spec.js
describe("Given my code", function () {

	beforeEach(function () {
		/* ... Set up your test ... */
	});

	afterEach(function () {
		/* ... Tear it down ... */
	});

	describe("When ...", function () {

		beforeEach(function () {
		  /* ... Context specific setup ... */
		});

		it("Then...", function () {
			expect(true).toEqual(true);
		});
	});
});
